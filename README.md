# Using re-sequencing to identify how *E.coli* bacteria evolve resistance to the T5 phage

You can see a walkthough for one of the mutants [here](https://mikheyevlab.github.io/bacteriaphagecourse/).

To launch the repository on Binder and carry out your own analyses click the tag [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MikheyevLab/bacteriaphagecourse/master?urlpath=rstudio)
 
## When you're done with the analysis

- **Download all the .vcf, .bam and .bai files.** The virtual machine is not persistent and will delete them.
- You might as well download the reference and annotation files (`/ref/NC_012967.1.*`), which you will need for IGV

Here is a walkthough of how to load data into the IGV browser:
